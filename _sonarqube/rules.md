The issue tracking functionality of the plugin is based on so called [Rules or Checks](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Rules); these are applied over the source code to determine errors, reliabilities, logical flaws or code conventions broken, and processes them to determine remediaton cost and technical debt.
